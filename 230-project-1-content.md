# DOMINION

## I. Concept
Enter into the arena and face off against the strongest warriors in the land of Planos.

## II. Genres
Action, Adventure, Battle, Fighting, RPG, Strategy

## III. Platform
This game will be available on desktop only.

## IV. Story
The war between good and evil has finally ceased, but with excessive casualties. The gods have called upon the humans to help find the next
Holy Warrior to be the sole divine protector of the world. We have gathered the greatest warriors in the world to one arena, in the land of
Planos, to face off against each other to see who will be the next Holy Warrior of the gods.

You are scared. You have yet to see an arena of this caliber in the pristine Planos. There is no way of knowing what the other warriors are like.
They could be scared as well, but you will never know. What you do know is that you must win. For your family, and for yourself.

Fight through enemies as you climb to the top of the ladder, with the goal of becoming the all-powerful Holy Warrior. Unlocking new weaponry
as you progress, destroy any fighter that stands in your way.

## V. Aesthetics
The game will most likely be stick figures fighting, or basic cartoonish characters. The sound will just be an ambient piece played in the 
background.

## VI. Gameplay
The game will consist of a standard combat style. The player can either use a basic attack which does less damage, but can hit twice, or a 
power attack that will crush through armor and potentially cause bleeding. There will be no items besides weaponry. To insinuate difficulty,
the player will not be capable of purchasing armor, but the AI can have an armor value. The game should not require a tutorial, it is pretty
straight forward.
